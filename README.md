========

*Project Description*
This is a website containing some commonly used SEO tools. I have only added a blog ping utility at this time but there is more to come. 

*Jeremy's SEO Tools*

This is a collection of SEO tools for use on an ASP.Net website. I only have one tool for now, but plan to add more. 

We currently have

- Blog Pinger - Pings multiple blog update sites when you've updated your blog

Future plans:

- Code to text ratio tool
- html compressor
- image optimizer
- keyword analyzer
- backlink checker

This project is open to any suggestions or contributions. If you want to change or add anything send a pull request!

You can view the current version of this site here: [Jeremy's SEO Tools on Iron Foundry](http://seotools.ironfoundry.me).

These tools are created by me, [Jeremy Morgan](http://www.jeremymorgan.com) as a suite of tools for my blog.

I hope to be adding more soon
